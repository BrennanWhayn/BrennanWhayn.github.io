## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 10, Part 2
This was my favorite lab because I improved my coding skills and learned how to calculate the population density for states which was fresh and interesting. I found coding with vectors to also be very straightforward and simple to understand and complete, leading to me not asking for help as much and fully experiencing the lab.

* Lab 7, Part 1
This was my second favorite lab because we learned how to use boolean code which was a nice challenge and new. I also enjoyed troubleshooting the parking signs and making a code to determine when it was safe to park at allotted times. I had a great time with my partner partly because we both hated allotted time parking spaces so it was almost a necessity for both of us to figure out the times to park and implement it into our code.

* Lab 9, Part 1
This was my third favorite lab. I enjoyed figuring out how spellcheckers are made. Even if ours was a little basic and simple. This was the first lab that I saw const a lot which was tricky starting out at first. But the lab progressively got easier as we understood const. I found myself enjoying this lab and laughing at moments even during the trickier parts which shows it was well designed for students.
